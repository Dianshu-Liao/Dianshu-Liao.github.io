<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Australian National University (ANU), under the supervision of [Xiaoyu Sun](https://sunxiaobiu.github.io/), [Zhenchang Xing](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/zhenchang-xing/), and [Alwen Tiu](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/alwen-tiu/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from Jiangxi Normal University. My research focuses on Intelligent Software Engineering and Knowledge Graphs.

I am open to collaboration and welcomes inquiries from individuals with overlapping research interests. Please feel free to reach out if you believe our research interests align.
